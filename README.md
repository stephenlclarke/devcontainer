Run VS Code-compatible Development Containers on Apple silicon through stock [`apple/container`](https://github.com/apple/container), with first-class support for [`container-compose`](https://github.com/stephenlclarke/container-compose).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Version 1.0.0 is the current release candidate, not yet a published stable
> release. Its eventual compatibility claim is bound to the exact versions in
> [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) and is published only after real Docker,
> unmodified Apple `container` 1.1.0, and the separately maintained
> `container-compose` provider stack pass all 18 CLI fixtures plus the real
> VS Code end-to-end fixture with zero normalized semantic differences.

## See it work

![Live terminal recording of a Dev Container starting and running on stock Apple container](docs/images/devcontainer-demo.gif)

The recording starts the local compatibility endpoint, runs the official
`@devcontainers/cli` against the checked-in [hello example](Examples/hello),
executes its lifecycle hook, reads the mounted workspace from the running
Apple container, and proves exact cleanup. It is generated from
[docs/devcontainer-demo.tape](docs/devcontainer-demo.tape) with
[VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs); every displayed result comes from
the live command immediately above it. Recreate it on a release host with
`make demo`.

## Design promise

The project keeps the official [Dev Containers](https://github.com/devcontainers)
toolchain above a local Docker Engine compatibility service. VS Code and the
reference [`@devcontainers/cli`](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) remain
unmodified; the service translates their tested Docker API subset into
Apple-native runtime operations.

    ComposeChoice --> DockerCompose["Docker Compose over the bridge"]
    ComposeChoice --> ContainerCompose["container-compose adapter"]
    DockerCompose --> API
    ContainerCompose --> Stock
```

The `container-compose` integration is first-class but independently installed.
The core does not import `ComposeCore`, and installing this project never
silently replaces stock Apple `container` with the matched fork stack.

## Compatibility target

| Lane | Purpose | Stable-release requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real Docker | Behavioral oracle using pinned Docker Engine, Docker Compose, and `@devcontainers/cli` | Complete raw and normalized evidence |
| Stock Apple | Official `apple/container` only; Docker Compose uses the compatibility API | Zero semantic differences in every claimed fixture |
| `container-compose` provider | Stephen Clarke's separately installed `container-compose`, with its exact runtime provenance recorded | Zero semantic differences in every claimed fixture |

The test plan covers image, Dockerfile, Features, users, environment, lifecycle hooks, workspace mounts, ports, reuse, Compose services, networks, volumes, failure recovery, and real VS Code attach/rebuild behavior. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) and [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

Stock `apple/container` 1.1.0 does not expose create-time hostname or Docker
security-option fields. Requests containing those fields fail before container
or mount side effects; they are not silently weakened and are outside the stock
1.1.0 compatibility claim. A separately fingerprinted enhanced runtime may
advertise and enforce them through native `--hostname` and `--security-opt`
flags.

## Development

Requirements are Xcode 26, Swift 6.2 or newer, Python 3, and `make`.
Runtime parity additionally requires a physical Apple-silicon Mac on macOS 26,
stock Apple `container`, real Docker, the pinned Dev Container CLI, and the
selected Compose provider.

The stock multi-service path uses the upstream `docker-compose` client over
this project's compatibility socket. The separately selected
`container-compose` provider remains optional and independently installed.

```console
make check
make test
make docs
make serve-docs
DEVCONTAINER_VSCODE_LIVE=1 make parity-vscode-docker
```

Use `devcontainer diagnostics --output devcontainer-diagnostics.tar.gz` to
create a bounded, privacy-redacted support archive whose JSON manifest is
printed before the archive is written.

Live runtime tests are deliberately not run on public pull-request code or GitHub-hosted macOS. They execute on an isolated physical runner only after a trusted exact commit has passed hosted checks.

## Documentation

The generated [DocC site](https://stephenlclarke.github.io/devcontainer/)
contains the public Swift API reference and architecture articles. GitHub Pages
publishes it from the exact `main` commit that passes the documentation
workflow.

## Primary upstream references

The design follows the maintained sources in the [Dev Containers GitHub organization](https://github.com/devcontainers):

- [Development Containers Specification](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec)
- [Dev Container CLI reference implementation](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)
- [Dev Container Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features)
- [Dev Container Templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates)
- [Dev Container Images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images)
- [Dev Container CI](https://github.com/devcontainers/ci)
- [containers.dev specification and supporting tools](https://containers.dev/)

Runtime references are [Apple container](https://github.com/apple/container), [Apple containerization](https://github.com/apple/containerization), and the [Apple container API documentation](https://apple.github.io/container/documentation/). VS Code behavior is documented in [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

## Install

Requirements are an Apple-silicon Mac running macOS Tahoe 26 or later and
Apple [`container` 1.1.0](https://github.com/apple/container/releases/tag/1.1.0).
Install Apple's signed package first, then install `devcontainer`:

When macOS asks whether the selected runtime's `container-runtime-linux` may
find and connect to devices on the local network, choose **Allow**. Stock mode
uses Apple's signed helper; the optional provider stack uses its separately
installed helper. macOS can list them as distinct Local Network entries.
Denying either helper leaves its host listener open but resets connections with
`No route to host`.

```console
brew tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew trust --tap stephenlclarke/tap
brew install stephenlclarke/tap/devcontainer
/usr/local/bin/container system start
brew services start stephenlclarke/tap/devcontainer
devcontainer doctor --container /usr/local/bin/container
```

Use the compatibility socket only in the shell that needs it:

```console
eval "$(devcontainer context)"
npx --yes @devcontainers/cli@0.88.0 up \
  --workspace-folder /path/to/project
```

For VS Code, configure the Compose wrapper once and launch the workspace from
that configured shell:

```json
{
  "dev.containers.dockerComposePath": "/opt/homebrew/bin/devcontainer-compose"
}
```

```console
eval "$(devcontainer context)"
code /path/to/project
```

Optional Apple CLI plug-in registration is explicit and reversible:

```console
devcontainer plugin register
container devcontainer doctor
```

The stable formula installs this project with upstream Docker CLI and Docker
Compose protocol-client dependencies; it does not install a container runtime.
Plug-in registration is an explicit, reversible symlink into the active
runtime's reported install root, and it never replaces a foreign registration.
`container-compose` remains an explicit optional installation and provider
choice. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for stock/custom runtime selection,
service management, upgrades, verification, troubleshooting, and removal.
